## Inspiration

I drew inspiration from [Pranjal Shikhar](https://github.com/pranjalshikhar), a talented developer. I initially found his project in JavaScript and decided to take it a step further by migrating it to TypeScript. Along the way, I added new components and made various enhancements, shaping it into the website you see today.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
    ```
   cd your-portfolio
    ```
3. **Install Dependencies (if applicable):**
    ```
    pnpm install
    ```

## Usage

- Customize the content in the `app`, `components`, and `hooks` folder, which are in the `src` folder, to add your project details and personal information.
- Modify the styles in each file to match your design preferences; Since this project was built with Tailwind CSS, the styling is inline with the component. For example, to change the styling of the `CategoryCard.tsx` file, just edit `className` & your style will change.
- Located in the root `public` folder, update the `assets` folder with images, icons, or any additional files needed for your portfolio.

## Customization

Feel free to customize this portfolio template according to your needs. Add more sections, change the styling, or incorporate additional features to make it uniquely yours.
